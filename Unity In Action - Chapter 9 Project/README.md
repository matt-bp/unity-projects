# Chapter 9 Project

This project includes the following:
- Programming doors that the player can open
- Enabling physics simulations that scatter a stack of boxes
- Building collectible items that players store in their inventory
- Using code to manage game state, such as inventory data
- Equipping and using inventory items

The game state is done in a manner similar to MVC in web applications.
